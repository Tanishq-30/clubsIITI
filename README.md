# AIM:-
<ol>
	<li>Aim for our application is to eradicate the problem of students as because of the current pendemic situation   students are unable to apply for college clubs.
		So we have made this processes totally online.</li>
      <li>We have made the database system so that the club head can manage the data related to his club.
	      and he can also control  what all needs to be displayed on his club's web page.</li>
